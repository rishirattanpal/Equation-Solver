Plan:
What will I do:
•	Make an equation solver 
•	User inputs valid text which corresponds to an equation or system of equations 
•	Invalid input will be called out
•	Program then solves said equation
•	Types of equations it will solve linear, quadratic, cubic, systems of equations, inequalities, rational and differential equations/integral equations (potentially)
•	Make an aesthetic UI
•	Show working out

How will I do it:
•	Backend will be done in python/flask to handle the problems and produce an output
•	Frontend will be done in html, css and js
•	Html to display content of my web app
•	Css to make the content look nice
•	Js to make the app more interactive
•	Jinja to pass data from flask to html
•	When user inputs problem I will determine what type of equation it is and use the appropriate method, using sympy
•	Linear/ system of linear equations – Gaussian elimination
•	General purpose calculator 
•	Quadratics – quadratic equation
•	Polynomials – newton Raphson
•	Inequalities – context based
•	Differential equations (first order)
What will it look like:
•	Heading for title
•	Text box for problems lower down
•	Calculator like GUI for inputting problems
•	text box mid-section for displaying answers, initially set to instructions for the user
