motivation 

conclusion - my final product realisies my inital vision however I overestimated the time it 
would take to learn certain libraries/frameworks in 

what i have achieved:
working backend that supports:

calculator for input
graph visuliation
version controlled with git successfully 

what i aspire to achieve:
going to add graph support for z
add intersection for sim equation
add inequalitiy support
clear button on enter card and retain input
