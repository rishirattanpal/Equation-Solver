if no equation entered then be like enter a ting u nob

ADD ERROR HANDLING FOR INVALID EQUAION

get this to work for graph
2*x = y
y = 2

show basic arithmetic:
2+2 = 4 

show linear equations

2x + 23 = 43
x=10

show sim equations:
x = 0.5 * y
y = 0.5 * x + 3
x = 2.00
y = 4.00

x - y + z = 3 
2x + y + 8z = 18 
4x + 2y - 3z = -2
x=1.00
y=2.00
z=2.00

x + y = 2
x + y = 5
no solution


x + y = 2
2x + 2y = 4
x = 2
y = 0
(infinite sols)


show quadratics:

x^2 + 2x + 1 = 0
x = -1
(one root)


x^2 + 4x + 2 = 0
x = -0.586, 3.414
(two roots)




FIXING TING

answer: {'equation': ['x = 0.5*y', 'y = 0.5*x + 3'], 'solutions': {'x': 2.0, 'y': 4.0}}

answer: {'solutions': 'System has no solution (inconsistent system).'}




show polynomials:

x**3 - 6*x**2 + 11x - 6 = 0
x = 1, 2, 3


x**5 - 3*x**4 + x**3 - x**2 + 2*x - 2 = 0
x = 2.703, 0.6973+0.5421i, 0.6973−0.5421i, −0.5489+0.8044i, −0.5489−0.8044i


Talk about features i will include:
get rid of -0
going to add graph support for z
add intersection for sim equation
add inequalitiy support
