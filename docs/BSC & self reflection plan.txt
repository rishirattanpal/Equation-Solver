BSC & self reflection plan:
An ability to apply practical and analytical skills gained during the degree programme.
- COMP101 Intro to programming taught me the foundations of programming as well as python which I used for my backend
- COMP 201 Software engineering 1 taught me how to plan a project of this scale
- COMP 208 was good practice for making a large scale project (We made chess with a working AI and LAN
play) however this was a step up doing it on my own
- COMP 218 Introduction to theory of computation taught me how regular expressions work which I used
in the pre-processing function 


Innovation and/or creativity.
- the design and layout for this application is original
- ? unsure what else to write/reference if anything


Synthesis of information, ideas and practices to provide a quality solution together with an evaluation of that solution.
- Refer to sections 2.1 + 2.2, real methods to solve equations from other people that I have implemented in my own
way through code

That your project meets a real need in a wider context.
- Reference 2.4 - shows the uses for equations 

An ability to self-manage a significant piece of work.
- followed the gantt chart and achieved a final product that fulfils my initials requirements


Critical self-evaluation of the process.
